# Azure Healthcare RCM Pipeline
This project implements an end-to-end data pipeline for processing healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) data. It ingests, cleans, transforms, and aggregates patient and claims data to produce analytics-ready datasets.

The pipeline follows the Medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) and is built entirely on Azure services with Python and PySpark for transformations.


**Key Highlights**:

- Simulated healthcare claims and EMR data processing.
- Bronze/Silver/Gold layers for clean and structured data.
- Data quality checks to ensure reliability.
- Aggregated analytics suitable for reporting or dashboards.
